#### Format:
1) contains directory with gene/gene family name, with `msf` and `fasta` subdirectories

2) `msf` and `fasta` subdirectories contain multiple sequence alignment and fasta files respectively, file formatting follows IMGTHLA database: [https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA)
